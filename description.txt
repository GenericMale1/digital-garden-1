The digital garden is inpired by an example done in class to do with objects and reusability. I wanted to evoke the feeling of an imagined garden in a future where we no longer have gardens , and the only things we do have are abstract ideas of what flowers in a garden/field shhould look like and operate. This is in no way meant to reflect reality - which is what i'd like to experiment with.
We've all got preconcieved ideas of what gardens should do and be.
But when we dont look at something for a long long time, the idea becomes greater than the object itself.

Part of my work is inspired by interactive internet pieces from Chia Amisola - whose take on internet spaces as spaces of interaction really stands out to me.
As our spaces grow digital everyday, and the physical shrinks to nothingness, we will have to find digital spaces to congregate.

How strange.
